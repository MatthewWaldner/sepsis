# SepSIS

## About SepSIS

## Requirements and Acknowledgements


SepSIS is loosely based on the SPAdes [Recycler](https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/Recycler) utility. Two of the scripts present in SepSIS contain functions from Recycler. "make_fasta_from_fastg.py" and "recycler_utils.py" contain basic utility functions from Recycler for working with .fastg files. "recycler_utils.py" also contains a function cited by the authors of Recycler as [lh3's fast fastX reader](https://github.com/lh3/readfq/blob/master/readfq.py).
